## Course Description

This course is about learning everything you need to use React Hooks in your React apps, as well as how to build your own custom Hooks to satisfy your own state and component lifecycle management. In this course, Using Hooks in React 18, you’ll learn to use React Hooks in your function components as well as understand the motivation behind hooks. First, you’ll explore what a React Hook actually is by building your own useState Hook from scratch. Next, you’ll discover the built-in React Hooks provided by the React Facebook team. Finally, you’ll learn how to combine the built-in Hooks and Hooks you build yourself, as well as third-party Hooks into real world React apps. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of React Hooks needed to build highly performant, easily maintainable React apps that provide an awesome user experience to your end users.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 16 (latest-verson) with NPM 17](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-using-hooks-in-react18` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-using-hooks-in-react18/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m3` - `cd m4`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`



## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
